# 3DCam

Blob detection on 3DCam, no supporting TerraBee 3DCam (80x60) and intel RealSense.

## TODO
- Exit 3DCam server on cam crash (to trigger systemd restart)
- Exit 3DCam server if no data after X minutes (to trigger systemd restart)

- 3DCam has been revamped for Intel RealSense, Terrabee might be broken..
check it!

- Dual operation, with autodetect ?
- Install script


## NOTES TerraBee 80x60

- install SDK ? or ./Redist enough ?
